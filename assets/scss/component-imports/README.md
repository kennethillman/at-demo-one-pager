# COMPONENT IMPORTS


This directory contains all files that will imported to EVERY component in this app.
Dont keep any scss files containing classes in this directory. The class will be duplicated for every component and bloat the CSS on the site. 

This directory should only contain Vars, Mixins and Functions. 

If you really need to or want to use a global class check the global folder "assets/scss/global".
